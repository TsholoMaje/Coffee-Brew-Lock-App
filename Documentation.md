#Documentation - Coffee Brew Log App
## Project Overview
This project was part of XPL full stack developer Bootcamp. The goal was to build a Coffee Brew Log App that allows users to:
Create a brew entry
View brews in a list
Filter brews by method
Edit entries
Delete entries
## What I completed
For this submission, i focused on the front-end implementationn.
I used html and css to build a responsive layout.
Created a form for entering new brew details(brew name, method,beans, water).
Build a simple list vie to display brew entries
Styled the user interface for clarity and usability.
## What i planned but did not finish
For filtering, editing, and deleting enteries i planned to use Javascript functunality.
Back-end API setup with Node.js.
Database Integration (SQL) for storage.
Deployment to a hosting service.
## Learning Reflection
Through this project I:
Strengthened my HTML/CSS skills
Practiced structuring forms
I also realized where i need to focus next, Javascript for interactivity and Back-end frameworks (node.js) and connecting to databases.
## Next steps
Add Javascript to handle filtering
Use a frmework like React once I am more confident to rebuild the app
Connect to a back-end API and database for persistence
Deploy to a hosting platform such as Netlify.
## Notes 
Though I couldnt complete all the requirements for this project. I'm proud of the work i did on front-end. This was a valuable learning experince and I plan to keep on practicing soo i can attempt it successfully in the future.
